# Hello-World
This is my first repository on GitHub
I like to vape and learn; learn and vape. 
Raspberry pis are cool and I plan on developing 
custom solutions with them for: 
- Leopard gecko lighting, watering, and feeding
- RpiHTPCs with remote controlled shutdown and boot
- Alarm and camera systems
