# Hello-World
This is my first repository on GitHub
I like to vape and learn; learn and vape. 
Raspberry pis are cool and I plan on developing 
custom solutions with them for: 
- Leopard gecko lighting, watering, and feeding
- RpiHTPCs with remote controlled shutdown and boot
- Alarm and camera systems

So I had some ideas 
-Remote controlled Rpi shutdown and boot
--1. Rpi senses power off state of TV
---Run Shutdown of Rpi
----Either a script to kill power to Roi after delay
----OR
----Delay ppwer kill to outlet Rpi is in based on pwer state of TV
-2. Powe on immediately and remotely
--CEC controlled power strip
--OR
--When TV power is on, power to Rpi outlet
-3. Shutdown Routing and boot routing of TV and Rpi are synced 
--Remote initiation 
--Some command (CEC??) to intiate Rpi shutdown
----CEC to shutdown TV
-4. Remote to provide power back to Rpi 
---OR
---Put Rpi to sleep and wake
